## Introduction
While lending money or taking loan from someone, keeping track of the cash flow becomes a hectic task if a person has to keep record of it. Especially in Kirana/General stores where, there is daily flow of lending and loaning money. Aprt from this all bachelors, be it College students or working professionals, keeping track of money , where it goes and where ot comes from, is a good practice to better manage personal finance. 

Thus the aim of this project is to create a book keeping application, thus the name UDHAAR, where the user can keep track of all record of money flow between himself and other transactees. The user can keep track of how much money they have lent or loaned and what ois their current transactional state with that person, is he in debt of that person or in credit. HE can also keep track of dates of each every last transaction that happend between them.

## Research
![](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/mockup2.png)
Currently in the market, there are applications which satisfy the proposed needs. There is a high demand of book keeping/ledger type applications as the working population of India is increasing day by day. Also the fast paced lives of people has led to a deamnd in fast and efficient book keeping applications.
### Advantages :
1.It satisfies fast book keeping requirement of the user and helps to get away with the monotonous task of manual ledgering.

2.All records of transactions cannot be tampered  as a digital key can always be applied for security.

3.Since all records are digitally stored, acession of data can become fast and easy and flexible. 

## Cost and Features

--> In the early 1900s , IBM had invented the punching machine mechanism for accounting purpose. By the 1920's this mechanism was optimised to process the cards efficiently in large batches. 

-->Then in the mid 1900's , from 1950s-60's, UniVAC Became quite famous as General Electric purchased it for paying factroy payroll.But the size of the machine was humnogous and would cost nearly $7million at today's date.  

-->Towards the erly 2000's, when Quickbook was launched, it domniated the market of book keeping. Today around  4.5 million companies use quickbook and the estimated cost of the software is $300.

-->In todays time, with the indcution of Artificial Intelligence, machine learning and ubiqutous software tools, the task of book keeping has taken leaps from when it had inintiated and its cost has also substantially decresed to practically free softwares being available. 


## Defining Our System
   In the implemetation of the system, the design is very simple and efficient. The user has 3 operations to perform:
   
   1. Add a new UDHAAR transaction : When the user creates branch of UDHAAR with new 2nd party, this function provides the functionality to enter UDhaar Information.
   
   2. Update an existing UDHAAR transaction : Using this function the User can update the data of loan taken/ Given at any point of time to or from 2nd party.
   
   3. View all UDHAAR data: This operation allows the user to view a tabular representaion of all the UDHAAR data.
   
   
## SWOT ANALYSIS

SWOT - STRENGTH WEAKNESS OPPORTUNITES THREATS

### STRENGTH  
    1. Strong Record keeping functionality
    2. All data available in one spot
    3. Automation of manual processes
    4. Mimics existing systems, thus availabilty of feature refernces
### WEAKNESS
    1. Limited functionality in the current system.
    2. Need for more automation and modularization
    3. Limited to No graphical user interface
    4. File based so locally acessible only (currently)
    5. Since similar to Database transctional process, no implementaion of ACID properties.
### OPPORTUNITIES
    1. Gaining KNowledge of the existing sytems and functionalities
    2. Skill impromvement and implementaion of better development practices
    3. Getting to know more about market requirment for the proposed problem
    4. Open sourceing
### THREATS 
    1. Not secure from data corruption
    2. Malpractice can tamper data
    3. System creash can erase all data
    4. If secured, removing access by mistake and destroy accessibilty of file system

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
   All individuals bachelors and working professionals for personal use. Also small size shops which currently have manual record keeping sytems. 

## What:
   Automated digital UDHAAR record keeping system to keep track of transcations easily and efficiently. Removes manual labour and handwritten complexitiies.
   
## When:
   Problem began gaining recognition when demand for efficient and speedy record keeping increased with exponential increase in working professionals. Also manual                                                            book keeping demanded shift to a more efficient and optimized way of processing data, possibly digital.

## Where:
   Applicable possibly in every household, personal financial systems and small shops not only in INDIA and around the world.

## How:
   Manual book keeping may be time consuming and at some point with large amount of records me become ineffective. Also keeping mere notes of transction data can lead to inconsistencies and major problems like comeplete loss or misplacement of record data.
