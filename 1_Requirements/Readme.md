Aprt from this all bachelors, be it College students or working professionals, keeping track of money , where it goes and where ot comes from, is a good practice to better manage personal finance.

The user can keep track of how much money they have lent or loaned and what ois their current transactional state with that person, is he in debt of that person or in credit.
